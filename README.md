# Jetson_Nano_Power_Statistics
This repository contains power statistics of NVIDIA's Jetson Nano while training face recognition model and also inferencing. I used the jtop library to collect the data and to control the active CPU cores, CPU frequency and GPU frequency I edited the nvpmodel.conf file found at /etc/nvpmodel.conf.
